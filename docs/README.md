Hey!

Not sure how you made it here. This is a messy place, full of abstractions and references I only know about. This is because it is an attempt to map my understanding of the world and store what does not fit inside my brain. Therefore the content you will find here is not written in order to be consumed by others. It is my personal truth, organized and structured for me only.

That said, feel free to bother, ask or give me any kind of feedback about anything you want.
