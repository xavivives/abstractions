This is a some sort of subset of the Literal/Strict Definition sytem

The basic idea is that for a given subject there will be multiple definitions of it. Each definition will have more detail that the previous.

The goal is that a reader can adapt the lecture to his knowledge.

A potential way to experiment with it without commiting to much on tooling would be to use standard markdown documents.

The H1 would represent the minimum description
H2 would be the same description as the H1 but with more details and so on...

Using Nested-Mardown could provide better tooling

The  data types based on the  IPLD Mindmap makes it trivial.
The UI for it is much mor complex.

- The same idea is explained with multiple resolutions (more or less detail)
- The Headers can be used to capture this hierchy
- So the content of H3 is the same content of the H1 but with higher resolution
- Can an H3 be understood without an H2? Can an H2 be understood without an H1?
