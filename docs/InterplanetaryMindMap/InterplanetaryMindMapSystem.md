# Interplanetary Mind-map

It is an infinite game to transcend our collective minds

# The System

This is an attempt to define the overall architecture of the Interplanetary Mind-map

- Write down current idea of the whole system
  - Mapping/Organization
  - Versioning
    - Blockchain like data structures
  - Identity/Entity/Proofs
  - Storage/avaibility/redundancy
  - Global domain/ENS/IPNS
  - Accessibility/sharability/encryption

A system that mimics the fabric of reality (map)
Where the actors are the atomic processing components (mind)
And its ~~global~~ interplanetary

## Mapping
- How is information connected
## Identity
- Understanding of the world
  - Literal definitions
- Proobable claims
## Storage
- IPFS allows us to decuple data from information
- Storage/Redundancy
## Accessibilty
- Sharing mechanisms
- 
- Concensus mecchanisms
  - ENS
  - Crypto currencies
## Applications
- Processing
- Render

1. Understand the primitives
2. Work bottom up

# Why
- Why can't get an alert if on the street I pass by somone as facinated for mapping the world like me 
- Why I do I need to spend two hours reading and filtering google search results for a subject that my friend has already filtered?
- Why I can't make queries of information using any alghorithm I please?
- Why I can't see all my personal infomration in one place and play around with it efficiently.
- I'm managing tons of infomration daily. I need to organize it. But I don't want constrains on formats, sizes, origins, sharability.
- Why I can't connect two pieces of info in any way I want?

We can do all that. Is just not efficient. And for every problem we solve, we add more complexity for the next one.
It is the tragedy of the commons
- In our desperate race for instant gratification and economic returns we created a digitial universe so fragmented that is blocking our personal growth.

# How

- We need to solve the problem from the very bottom. Redefining how data is stored and opperated
- Now we can move to infomration
- Data are ones and zeros, information has human meaning.
- Exercices
- Infinite game
  
# Found
- Minds are the center
- There is only the truth of each of us

## Primitives

##

Mind as a target
Distributed
Atomic information
Decouple data from information
Global domain
Decouple data from processing from rendering

# Rules of the game

It inherits the properties of the decentralize and distributed system topologies.
The atomic conceptual unit of the system is the mind

# Conceptual stack

## Mapping

### Mental ontology

It is critical for the mission of the project to be able to construct digital models of our understanding of the world. That means to represent any conciebable information  (state, relationship) of any entity (unique digital representation of a piece of data/identity/organization/ object), in a way that is comprehensible each of our minds.

The complex and abstract nature of a mind is in constant conflict with the limitiations and rigidity of the digital tools. While limitations will always exist, it is the goal to the system to allow to define the bounderies and tools that allow each mind to find more fundamental ways of digital expression.

## Identity

An identity is the sum of all your passed experiences...

> The end will end when the word `map` does no longer make sense after `Interplanetary mind`
