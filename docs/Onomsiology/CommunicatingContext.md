# Communicating context

A lot of missunderstadings between humans is due to not having enough resolution when we communicate, and assuming that the quality of the communication was good enough.

### Explanation
Let's take the verb `to want`

These are very common questions:

> What do you want?  or  Do you want X?

...with no context regarding the perspective of wanting is impossible to respond without especulating about what the questioner "wants".

For example:
> Do you want ice-cream?

- Do I desire it?
- Do I want it, considering that I'm trying not to not eat sugar?
- Do I want it if I'm the one paying?
- Do I want to be seen eating ice-cream?

It is such a common question that it is extrange to add the context. Although I believe is critical if we want to get good information.

Most of the people especulate about what the questioner wants, without asking for more details. 

Due to the high friction of adding context, we neglect it. And it has become and standard.

Fast paced life-styles are at more risk of loosing resolution when communicating.

This applies to other verbs as well: `can`, `love`, `like`...


### Open questions
> What do these verbs that need extra context have in common?

> How different languages provide the necessary context?

> How can we add more context without an overhead?

> How can we have more resolution without more context?

> How the context differs between written/spoken/visual... mediums?

> Programming languages force context by not allowing to call certain functions unless you match a certain interface. Could humans communicate similarly?
