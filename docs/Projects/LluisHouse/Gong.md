- The thicker the plate the longer and lowder the vibration will last
- A flat surface vibrates more
  
## Potential metal base
- An "aixada" plate
- The "ring" of the "aixada" cutted in spiral
- A "desbrocadora" old blade

## Random ideas
- Make use of sun/wind to create effects
- Levitating gong trough and induction base?
- Can be horizontal
- Use an light bulb thread to hold the actioner and the gong

##  Actioners
- Like a drums pedal
- Balls falling on top of it
- Linear actuator (like the ones of the car doors)
- Spinning motor
- Servo motor

## Automation
- Using wifi relays like sonoff
  - Can be easly programmed
