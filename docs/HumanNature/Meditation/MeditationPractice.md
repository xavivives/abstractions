## Motivations

### Find serenity
On January of 2017 I suffered an important lost that caused unpressedented levels of anxiety all through the following year.

Out of need to calm myself down I've attempted several times to incorporate meditation to my routine. I used different techniques and resources. While some sessions were beneficial and helped a lot to recover my senses that moment, it never become a routine, once I was a little calmer the motivation to keep the practice faded away. Also my personal situation improved on its own.

I did not have any preferred practice, nor that I understood what "meditation" meant.
At that point meditation was just a way to calm down and clear the mind.

If I have to recall a good resource, I'll point to [this document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/at1izzfovujp9xn/Vinay%20Gupta%20on%20Meditation.pdf?dl=0) by Vinnay Gupta. It gave me a comprehensive view about meditation and its practice, that 

### Interplanteary Mind-map
While working on the Interplanetary Mind-map project with Dani, we kept comming to the conclusion that the process that we were in to understand and change how digital information is used could not be decoupled from the fundamental nature of the human mind. And more explorations went on that direction.

### Vipassana course
I found several references to Vipassana, from authors and people that I value its opinion. Dani himself an another friend had done a 10 day course, so I did it as well.

The 10 day Viasssana course gave the resasoning, the guidence, and the experince necessary to believe and understand its benefits.

At the moment of writting this, only a couple days have passed since it the course finished. So at the moment the motivations are fresh and the integration of the practice to my routine is just an intention. I feel confident that I will keep it.

## Getting focus
My extreme capacity to wander makes it very hard to focus in order to follow `Vipassana` when I try to meditate. That's why I usually start with `Anapana`.

Usually I  count the breaths (inhale/exhale) that I've done conciously. Sooner or later I realize that my mind wandered and then I start over again. If I can manage at least 10 breaths I move on to `Vipassana`.

In the Vipassana course they made a lot of emphasis on not using any kind of object to keep the focus. Wording, counting, mantras or visualizations makes focusing easy, by centering the atention into a pattern. The collateral effect of it is that we stop percieving the sensations of the breathing.

I understand and agree with it, but I found that without counting most of the time I'm unable to even start the practice.

I minimize the effect by not making it a mechanincal process. What I do is to very conciously inhale and exhale, then, I evaluate how aware of the breath I was. If it was good enough, I add up to the counter.

## Posture
During the 10 day Vipassana course I had to fight several pains. One of them was the middle back. It was not strong enough to kept a cross-leg sitting position.

I could not keep the back stright for more than few minutes. A less straight version produced paint. If I sluched the pain was minimal at that moment but I would come during the next hours, especially in the neck and upper-back

### Cowboy style 
I found out that the this positioning of the hands eliminated completely the pain I had on the middle back.

I'm not sure exctly why but I believe that the pain was caused by the shoulders going inwards and not by the slouching spine. This positioning forces an open chest, keeping the shoulders in place.
It also delegates a little of the load of the upper-back to the arms.

Keeping the back stright is easier, but I also can rest it by slouching a bit, without soreness or pain afterwards.

The position is like a cowboy ready to shoot:
- the palms of the hands on top of tights
- at its begining, touching the hips
- the thumb facing forward
- the rest of the fingers pointing down

## 10 days Vipassana Course
On `09/01/2019` I attended a 10 days Vipassana course in [Dhama Neru](https://www.neru.dhamma.org/es/). I went with Ly.

We had registered the previous October. At `7:00` we were refreshing the inscriptions site in order to register, it gets fully booked within minutes after opening the inscriptions.

### Todo
- Days
- Food
- Mental process types
 - Anaconda/Sangoku ball
 - Comenting as a show-man to keep the attention

## Keeping the practice

### Group sittings
There is scheduled Vipassana group sittings to most of big sittings. Haven't experience it but I'm assuming they must be great to get reminded of the details while keep the motivation up.

### Create the habit
Creating a habit is hard. But if done results come on their own. I'm going to try to use the motivation I have right now after just few days out of the course to embeded it on my daily activities. First meditation, then the rest.

Goals:
- Make two meditations in the current day
- Don't miss any day
- Make it to a week
- Make it to a month
  
### Better done than perfect
While I'll try to keep a 60 min habit for each session, I know it will be hard. But like running/working/reading... Doing it, event if is short and super-shitty, is an order or magintud better than skipping it all together.

The reasoning is that the results of this practices come with large amounts of iterations. Skipping it one day doesn't matter. But because of our monkey mind, the collateral of it is that skipping it two days becomes much easier.

Better to do 30 or 10 min that not doing it at all. If abandoned is very hard to go back to it. While is much more easier that once practicing extend it a few more minutes.

### Community habit
I'm lucky to live with two practicioners of Vipassana.
We are in the process of making it part of our collective routine. Seeing the others doing it is a great motivation and reminder

### Temple/meditation box
Because start the practice is the hardest part, we want to minimize what it takes to get started.
By having an exclusive place for its practice you can easly ensure that it has everything it needs to do it: silence, good temperature, cushoning, no distractions...
It is therefore important the "exclusive" part of it. If used for other practices (focus working) in may be occupied by others, not be tiddy...

### Anywhere
I need to find ways to remind me of keeping the practice of `awareness` and `ecuanimity` on every-day situations.
Ideas:
- Phone notifications
- Stickers (in computer, phone, Orxata)
