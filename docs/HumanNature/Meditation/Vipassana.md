## Misery's nature
A `sensation` is anything we can percieve. An input; touch, smell, sound, image, thougt...
By default and unconciously we position ourself towards any `sensation`. We create a `assocition` in a spectrum between like/desire and dislike/aversion, based on the outcome of it.
A `sensations` only exist in the present. Therefore they are impermanent. They come and go, always.
`Misery` is the fear towards a forecasted `association` of a sensation (or the lost of if). Not the fear towards the `sensation` itself.
Desire an aversion are the root and only causes of all the `misery`
With training we can eliminate the `associations`. And therefore end `misery`.

## Vipassana
Vipassana is a technique to train the removal of `associations` towards `sensations` and therefore eliminate the default `reaction`.

We observe any sensation (awareness) and we we conciously do not react to it (equanimity). We accept the reality of the present without generating `associations`.

With repetition (persistence) we increase the resolution of the `sensations` (we percieve more detail), and we neutralize the `associations` towards them.

## Anapana
Anapana is a technique to to get mental focus and sharpness by only observing the `sensations` of the breathing, without altering it.

## Maximising efficiency
I found in the `On Intelligence` book great scientific explanations of how the brain, and specifically the neurocortex, manage these associetive processess that Vipassana tries to erredicate.

Based on what the book descrives it seems possible to create a practice/method that achieves the results of a Vipassana practice with much more efficiency.

To my limited understanding the type of outcome of a `sensation` defines how strong the `association` gets imprinted in our system.

For example:
_You only need to get to touch a hot object a couple of times to understand that it burns, but it may take you hundrets of iterations to realize that a sound is produced by a certain bird, if you realize about its existence in the first place._

To my understanding the imprint of a meditation practice is soft like the imprint of the `sensations` of a bird sound. It is only through large amounts of repetitions that we can slowly override the exsting `associations`.

**Could it be possible to create fewer, but stronger, imprints to accelarte the de-association?**  
My guess is that to some extend, psychedellic drugs and hard-core experiences are this. But, could we design and controll these imprints?

**Is removing an `association` the same process as creating or overriding an `association`?**
