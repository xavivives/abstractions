## Misery's nature
A `sensation` is anything we can percieve. An input; touch, smell, sound, image, thougt...
By default and unconciously we position ourself towards any `sensation`. We create a `assocition` in a spectrum between like/desire and dislike/aversion, based on the outcome of it.
A `sensations` only exist in the present. Therefore they are impermanent. They come and go, always.
`Misery` is the fear towards a forecasted `association` of a sensation (or the lost of if). Not the fear towards the `sensation` itself.
Desire an aversion are the root and only causes of all the `misery`
With training we can eliminate the `associations`. And therefore end `misery`.

## Vipassana
Vipassana is a technique to train the removal of `associations` towards `sensations`.

We observe any sensation (awareness) and we we conciously do not react to it (equanimity). We accept the reality of the present without generating `associations`.

With repetition we increase the resolution of the `sensations` (we percieve more detail), and we neutralize the `associations` towards them.

## Anapana
Anapana is a technique to to get mental focus and sharpness by only observing the `sensations` of the breathing, without altering it.

## Scientific understanding
I found in the `On Intelligence` book great scientific explanations of how the brain, and specifically the neurocortex, manage these associetive processess that Vipassana tries to erredicate.

Based on what the book descrives it seems possible to create a practice/method that achieves the results of a Vipassana practice with much more efficiency.

To my limited understanding the type of outcome of a `sensation` defines how strong the `association` gets imprinted in our system.

For example:
_You only need to get to touch a hot object a couple of times to understand that it burns, but it may take you hundrets of iterations to realize that a sound is produced by a certain bird, if you realize about its existence in the first place._

To my understanding the imprint of a meditation practice is soft like the imprint of the `sensations` of a bird sound. It is only through large amounts of repetitions that we can slowly override the exsting `associations`.

>Could it be possible to create fewer, but stronger, imprints to accelarte the de-association?
My guess is that to some extend, psychedellic drugs and hard-core experiences are this. But, could we design and controll these imprints?

>Is removing an `association` the same process as creating or overriding an `association`?

## .My meditation practice

### Getting focus
My extreme capacity to wander makes it very hard to focus in order to follow `Vipassana` when I try to meditate. That's why I usually start with `Anapana`.

Usually I  count the breaths (inhale/exhale) that I've done conciously. Sooner or later I realize that my mind wandered and then I start over again. If I can manage at least 10 breaths I move on to `Vipassana`.

In the Vipassana course they made a lot of emphasis on not using any kind of object to keep the focus. Wording, counting, mantras or visualizations makes focusing easy, by centering the atention into a pattern. The collateral effect of it is that we stop percieving the sensations of the breathing.

I understand and agree with it, but I found that without counting most of the time I'm unable to even start the practice.

I minimize the effect by not making it a mechanincal process. What I do is to very conciously inhale and exhale, then, I evaluate how aware of the breath I was. If it was good enough, I add up to the counter.

### Practicing Vipassana

## 10 days Vipassana Course
On `09/01/2019` I attended a 10 days Vipassana course in [Dhama Neru](https://www.neru.dhamma.org/es/). I went with Ly.

We had registered the previous October. At `7:00` we were refreshing the inscriptions site in order to register, it gets fully booked within minutes after opening the inscriptions.

## Motivations to meditate

### Find serenity
On January of 2017 I suffered an important lost that caused unpressedented levels of anxiety all through the following year.

Out of need to calm myself down I've attempted several times to incorporate meditation to my routine. I used different techniques and resources. While some sessions were beneficial and helped a lot to recover my senses that moment, it never become a routine, once I was a little calmer the motivation to keep the practice faded away. Also my personal situation improved on its own.

I did not have any preferred practice, nor that I understood what "meditation" meant.
At that point meditation was just a way to calm down and clear the mind.

If I have to recall a good resource, I'll point to [this document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/at1izzfovujp9xn/Vinay%20Gupta%20on%20Meditation.pdf?dl=0) by Vinnay Gupta. It gave me a comprehensive view about meditation and its practice, that 

### Interplanteary Mind-map
While working on the Interplanetary Mind-map project with Dani, we kept comming to the conclusion that the process that we were in to understand and change how digital information is used could not be decoupled from the fundamental nature of the human mind. And more explorations went on that direction.

### Vipassana course
I found several references to Vipassana, from authors and people that I value its opinion. Dani himself an another friend had done a 10 day course, so I did it as well.

The 10 day Viasssana course gave the resasoning, the guidence, and the experince necessary to believe and understand its benefits.

At the moment of writting this, only a couple days have passed since it the course finished. So at the moment the motivations are fresh and the integration of the practice to my routine is just an intention. I feel confident that I will keep it.
