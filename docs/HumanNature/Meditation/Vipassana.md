## Misery's nature
A `sensation` is anything we can percieve. An input; touch, smell, sound, image, thougt...
By default and unconciously we position ourself towards any `sensation`. We create a `assocition` in a spectrum between like/desire and dislike/aversion, based on the outcome of it.
A `sensations` only exist in the present. Therefore they are impermanent. They come and go, always.
`Misery` is the fear towards a forecasted `association` of a sensation (or the lost of if). Not the fear towards the `sensation` itself.
Desire an aversion are the root and only causes of all the `misery`
With training we can eliminate the `associations`. And therefore end `misery`.

## Vipassana
Vipassana is a technique to train the removal of `associations` towards `sensations`.

We observe any sensation (awareness) and we we conciously do not react to it (equanimity). We accept the reality of the present without generating `associations`.

With repetition we increase the resolution of the `sensations` (we percieve more detail), and we neutralize the `associations` towards them.

## Anapana
Anapana is a technique to to get mental focus and sharpness by only observing the `sensations` of the breathing, without altering it.


I found in the `On Intelligence` book great scientific explanations of these associetive processess.
