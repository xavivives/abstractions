## Session Log
I'm keeping a log of all [my meditations on airtable](https://airtable.com/shrx0uwi8Y6AyIPkZ/tblihkjG8ndGZT2P7).
It is part of my personal managment system. So it's not design specifically to fullfill the purpose of a meditation log.

I'm using the acronym/mnemonic FALSE POW (Proof of Work) to remember the inputs
I use an scale from `0` to `10` to evaluate each property.
- `0` is the minimum acceptable
- `10` is the potential maximum
- All metrics have positive read (`10` is always positive and `0` is always negative)

`F`ocus  
`A`ware: How sensitive I was  
`L`aps: How many iterations of Vipassana I did through the whole body  
`E`asy: How easy was to do it. Did I want to finish? Or I could meditate longer?  
`P`ose: Any insight regarding the posture. Position of the legs/sluching...  
`O`bservations: Any other feedback. Contextual information. Did I got a shower before? Was I anxious?  
`W`here: Locality. In `Orxta`? In a bed?

## Insights log

This are more long term insights

`February 1st`
- It's been a couple of weeks since the course.
- I've been able to do one practice a day.
- Except for today, all practice have been of `60min`
- Alomst all of the practices have been at `7:00` after a cold shower
- **My focus capacity as well as my sensibility have been declining.**
- I believe to be two majore factors for the decline:
  - Not enough hours
  - Not the right time
- For now I can' add more hours, but I will try to change the time:
  - I believe the ideal time to mediate should be:
    - Around mid-day
    - After workout/run
    - After a cold shower
  - Because
    - All stress is released
    - Mind is sharp
    - Recovery is needed
