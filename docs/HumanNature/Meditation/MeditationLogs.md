## Session Log
I'm keeping a log of all [my meditations on airtable](https://airtable.com/shrx0uwi8Y6AyIPkZ/tblihkjG8ndGZT2P7).
It is part of my personal managment system. So it's not design specifically to fullfill the purpose of a meditation log.

I'm using the acronym/mnemonic FALSE POW (Proof of Work) to remember the inputs
I use an scale from `0` to `10` to evaluate each property.

- `0` is the minimum acceptable
- `10` is the potential maximum
- All metrics have positive read (`10` is always positive and `0` is always negative)

`F`ocus  
`A`ware: How sensitive I was  
`L`aps: How many iterations of Vipassana I did through the whole body  
`E`asy: How easy was to do it. Did I want to finish? Or I could meditate longer?  
`P`ose: Any insight regarding the posture. Position of the legs/sluching...  
`O`bservations: Any other feedback. Contextual information. Did I got a shower before? Was I anxious?  
`W`here: Locality. In `Orxta`? In a bed?

## Insights log

This are more long term insights

`February 1st, 2019`

- It's been a couple of weeks since the course.
- I've been able to do one practice a day.
- Except for today, all practice have been of `60min`
- Alomst all of the practices have been at `7:00` after a cold shower
- **My focus capacity as well as my sensibility have been declining.**
- I believe to be two majore factors for the decline:
  - Not enough hours
  - Not the right time
- For now I can' add more hours, but I will try to change the time:
  - I believe the ideal time to mediate should be:
    - Around mid-day
    - After workout/run
    - After a cold shower
  - Because
    - All stress is released
    - Mind is sharp
    - Recovery is needed

`February 28th, 2019`

- Switched to meditate after showering and workin out in the middle of the day.
- Results were better but not much improvement could be seen
- I haven't meditated in the last 4 days.
  - Main excuse is business (not a real excuse)
  - But it is combined with the fact that I feel less compelled with Vipassana aproach
- While I agree with the fundamental logic of Vipassana, I don't think the practice is efficent enough
  - What I got from the course is that most of the practice is about observing physical sensationsaround the body
  - While I can understand how this will eventually bring extreme awereness it seems that I wouldmake much more sense to focus on mental sensation, thoughts, unresloved issues...
- I've been reading Vinay's pdf again
  - There are several insights there, but I'm just writtin about the ones regarding the practice, notthe motives.
  - A key insight there is that common meditation practices are decendant from monastery practices
    - Those are not meant to constantly face the reality of human nature (which I do).
  - He optimize meditation for efficency, not for eventual removal of suffering.
  - The practice is as follows (2x)
    - Mantra meditation for focus (10min)
    - Mental radio listening (10min). Listen to the log of your mind effortlessy..He compares this toVipassana, but I feel it is something different
    - Sense bad feelings (10min) (emotions, anxiety). Try to feel them as hard as you can, soeventually you get to the root of its cause.
  - Consistency is more important that get it right.
- I'll try to start Vinay's practice
  - This implies to change the metrics I use to get awareness of the process, but I can't deal with it now.
