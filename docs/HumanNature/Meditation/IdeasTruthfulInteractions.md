## Ideas for a more truthful daily interactions

- Before speaking, express the commit for being mindful about what I'm about to say.
    - Maybe doing a noticeable gesture, like touching the front-head

- Do not use verbs that express an egocentric preference
    - Instead, communicate the needs.
    - Nope: > I want ice-cream.
    - Yep: > I haven't had a good day today, I need to find some comfort, I believe an ice-cream can full-fill me.

- Do not use posesive pronouns
    - The goal is to de-associete ourself from capitalist like thinking
    - Use "responsible for" instead
    - Nope: Has someone seen the keys of **my** car?
    - Yep: Has someone seen the keys of the car that I'm **responsible for**?
